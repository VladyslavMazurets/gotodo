The main goal of this project was to improve one's own skills in using the Redux Toolkit, for this purpose this Todo List was created.

All saved tasks are displayed on the main page of this program ("/home"), completed tasks can be hidden using the Hide Done Tasks button.

To create new tasks, the + button is used, where the user can choose to which category his task belongs (work, study, etc.). After adding a task, the user can switch between categories and track their tasks. There is also a separate page on which only completed tasks are displayed.

All tasks are stored in localStorage so that when the user returns to the program, he does not lose his tasks.

## In this project, i used:
- ReactJS and TypeScript
- Tailwindcss, React Router, React Icons, Redux Toolkit.

Setup: run npm i && npm start - to start the development server
